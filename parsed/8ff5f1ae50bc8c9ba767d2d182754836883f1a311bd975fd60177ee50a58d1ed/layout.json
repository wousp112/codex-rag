That there should be a spread of life expectancy of 48 years among countries and 20 years or more within countries is not inevitable. A burgeoning volume of research identifies social factors at the root of much of these inequalities in health. Social determinants are relevant to communicable and non-communicable disease alike. Health status, therefore, should be of concern to policy makers in every sector, not solely those involved in health policy. As a response to this global challenge, WHO is launching a Commission on Social Determinants of Health, which will review the evidence, raise societal debate, and recommend policies with the goal of improving health of the world's most vulnerable people. A major thrust of the Commission is turning public-health knowledge into political action."

Within countries, too, there are large inequalities—a 20-year gap in life expectancy between the most and least advantaged populations in the USA, for example. One welcome response to these health inequalities is to put more effort into the control of major diseases that kill and to improve health systems."

Success will be achieved if institutions working in health at local, national, and global level will be using this knowledge to set and implement relevant public policy affecting health.

The poor health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is not the result of a high rate of child deaths. Infant mortality is 12·7 per 1000 livebirths. This figure is high by Australian standards, but on a scale from Iceland to Sierra Leone, it is much closer to Iceland than to Sierra Leone. The shortened life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples results from mortality in adults from non-communicable disease and injury. In this sense, the population is typical of the world health picture. Of the 45 million deaths among adults age 15 years and older in 2002, 32 million were due to non-communicable disease and a further 4·5 million to violent causes.[7]"

But poor health is not confined to poor populations or those who are socially excluded. As with child mortality, there is a socioeconomic gradient in adult mortality rates within countries. Figure 3 shows that in Bangladesh, adult mortality rates vary inversely with level of education.[11] This gradient in mortality is quite remarkable. Within rich countries, with strikingly different material conditions from Bangladesh, there is a social gradient in mortality prompting consideration of the causal links between status and health.[12] Whether the social gradient in poor countries can be attributed to the same causal pathways is an urgent task for review. It is especially important because, in many countries, inequalities in health have been increasing.[13-15] In Russia for example, where life expectancy is low, social inequalities have grown (figure 4).[16]"

While in Africa the major contributor to premature mortality is communicable disease, in every other region of the world it is non-communicable disease.1 Careful analysis of the global burden of disease has pointed to the importance of risk factors, such as being overweight, smoking, alcohol, and poor diet.20 These are indeed potent causes. But would it be helpful to go into a deprived Australian Aboriginal population and point out that they should really take better care of themselves—that their smoking and obesity were killing them; and if they must drink, please do so in moderation? Unlikely. To borrow Geoffrey Rose's term, we need to examine the causes of the causes:21 the social conditions that give rise to high risk of non-communicable disease whether acting through unhealthy behaviours or through the effects of impossibly stressful lives12 (panel 2)."

A social determinants perspective is crucial. It is also important to enquire whether the action that is taking place to relieve poverty is having the desired effect not only on average incomes but also on income distribution and hence on the poorest people."

If the major determinants of health are social, so must be the remedies. Treating existing disease is urgent and will always receive high priority but should not be to the exclusion of taking action on the underlying social determinants of health. Disease control, properly planned and directed, has a good history, but so too does social and economic development in combating major disease and improving population health. Wider social policy will be crucial to reduction of inequalities in health."

One standard answer is to measure economic wellbeing with measures such as GNP, average income, or consumption patterns. A better answer is to measure health status.[36] There is no difficulty in convincing medical and health personnel that health is important—that is what we do. It is more challenging, but necessary, to convince policy makers and others that the health of the population is important precisely because it is a measure of whether, in the end, a population is benefiting as a result of a set of social arrangements."
